# Windows Install Script

Provided is an install script/guide for when u do install windows and decide to set it up and install _everything_

# Steps

## Windows Installation

First of all, to actually use windows you should probably get an iso to actually install windows lol.\
Get the __Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC__ iso from <https://massgrave.dev/windows_ltsc_links> and _"burn"_ it onto some flash drive and boot into the installer\
Afterwards once inside make sure to change __Time and currency format__ to _English (World)_,\
Then reject the product activation (we'll get to it later) and select _Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC_\
And Format and install windows!\
_Note: once inside the OOBE it will throw an error OOBEREGION or smth around those lines just skip it_

TODO: make an actual script lol
